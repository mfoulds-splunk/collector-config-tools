type: '*probabilisticsamplerprocessor.Config'
doc: |
  Config has the configuration guiding the sampler processor.
fields:
- name: sampling_percentage
  kind: float32
  doc: |
    SamplingPercentage is the percentage rate at which traces or logs are going to be sampled. Defaults to zero, i.e.: no sample.
    Values greater or equal 100 are treated as "sample all traces/logs".
- name: hash_seed
  kind: uint32
  default: 0
  doc: |
    HashSeed allows one to configure the hashing seed. This is important in scenarios where multiple layers of collectors
    have different sampling rates: if they use the same seed all passing one layer may pass the other even if they have
    different sampling rates, configuring different seeds avoids that.
- name: attribute_source
  type: probabilisticsamplerprocessor.AttributeSource
  kind: string
  default: traceID
  doc: |
    AttributeSource (logs only) defines where to look for the attribute in from_attribute. The allowed values are
    `traceID` or `record`. Default is `traceID`.
- name: from_attribute
  kind: string
  default: ""
  doc: |
    FromAttribute (logs only) The optional name of a log record attribute used for sampling purposes, such as a
    unique log record ID. The value of the attribute is only used if the trace ID is absent or if `attribute_source` is set to `record`.
- name: sampling_priority
  kind: string
  default: ""
  doc: |
    SamplingPriority (logs only) allows to use a log record attribute designed by the `sampling_priority` key
    to be used as the sampling priority of the log record.
